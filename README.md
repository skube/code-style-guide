#CSS Code Style

Simple, terse guidelines for writing consistent, sane and scalable code. 
This is really just a reader's digest version of Harry Robert's http://cssguidelin.es/

- tabs for indentation, spaces for visual alignment
- 80 char length lines
- multi-line CSS
- No IDs used for CSS
- Specifity kept as low as possible
- Use the least number of selectors to style
- use `!important` proactively, not reactively
-
